HOLOGRAM DETECTION

This project aims to detect a certain specific hologram in a video. This was my intern based project, long time ago.

Create and activate a virtual env:

    virtualenv Hologram
    source Hologram/bin/activate
    
Install requirements:

        pip install -r requiremnts.txt

Run the script:

    python detection.py --video=input.mp4
where, input = name of the video file
